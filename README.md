AirBnB Clone
Project Description
The AirBnB Clone project is the first step toward building a full web application that emulates some of the functionality of the 
popular AirBnB platform. In this initial phase, we've developed a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, such as Users, States, Cities, and more. The command interpreter allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects while providing a clear and interactive user interface.
Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a command-line interface (CLI) built using Python and the cmd module. It allows you to interact with the AirBnB objects and perform various operations. Here's how to get started with the command interpreter:

How to Start It
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project's root directory.
$ ./console.py
Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

To create a new User object:

sql
Copy code
(hbnb) create User
To display information about a specific object (e.g., User with ID "123"):

sql
Copy code
(hbnb) show User 123
To update attributes of an object (e.g., User with ID "123"):

sql
Copy code
(hbnb) update User 123 name "John Doe"
To delete an object (e.g., User with ID "123"):

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) destroy User 123
To see a list of available commands and get help for a specific command (e.g., "create"):

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) help create
To exit the interpreter:

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) quit
This command interpreter allows you to manage AirBnB objects efficiently and provides a foundation for building the full AirBnB web application.
